# Simple PHP Blog System  

A basic blog system built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **HTML/CSS**. This project demonstrates CRUD operations for blog posts, with features like creating, editing, deleting, liking, and commenting on posts. The design is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making it easy to interact with blog content.  

## Features  
- Add, edit, delete blog posts.  
- Like and comment on posts.  
- View live counts for likes and comments.  
- Responsive design for all devices.  
- Footer with project credits: Mahfuz, Alif, and Lubna.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository and set up the database.  
2. Update database credentials in `db.php`.  
3. Run the project on a local server (e.g., XAMPP).

## Note  
Due to some database-related issues, I encountered challenges running the project directly from GitHub. Despite my best efforts, I couldnâ€™t find a suitable solution within the available time.  

Considering the upcoming final exam and time constraints, I decided to run the project on my PC and created a short video demonstration instead.  

I have included all the code in the "blog" folder and provided the video link for your reference, Mam: [Watch the Demo Video](https://youtu.be/QMzwzE4ZxPo).
