Due to some database-related issues, I encountered challenges running the project directly from GitHub. Despite my best efforts, I couldnâ€™t find a suitable solution within the available time. Considering the upcoming final exam and time constraints, I decided to run the project on my PC and created a short video demonstration instead. I have included all the code in the "blog" folder and provided the video link for your reference, Mam.
